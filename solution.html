      <section id="general">
        <h2>What can be done to improve?</h2>
        <p>From the findings in our research, Snapchat has room for improvemnt in a few aspects. The two main specific focuses are in the way the advertisements are handled, with the other being the placement of certain feautres that work alongside the navigation. </p>
        <p>Below we offer solutions to both of these problems. We believe that these changes would provide and better overall experience for the users of the application.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="ads">
        <h2>Solution for Ads</h2>
        <p>The ads integrated with sponsored stories feel very intrusive to users as they interrupt the user experience when viewing content. Additionally, these ads are timed and cannot be skipped for 7 seconds which further disrupts the viewing experience.</p>
        <p>The solution to this problem would be to remove the timers on ads can help make the ads feel less disruptive; other applications such as Instagram have a similar integration with story ads. The images below depcit this change.</p>
        <p>Before:</p>

        <p>After:</p>
        <img src="media/after.jpg" alt="New ads without timers">
        <p>Snapchat can also place ads in other locations such as amongst story tiles in order to blend in with the UI better and feel less intrusive. Some users also find the ad relevance to be annoying — the content of the ads do not appeal to users interests and lifestyles, 50% report feeling no inclination to interact with them. Improving ad algorithm could help resolve this and allow for ads to be better catered to users interests.</p>
        <p>Below is an example of where the ads could be reolacted to instead:</p>

      <section id="ai">
        <h2>Solution for Navigation</h2>
        <p>The “My AI” feature is also annoying to many users. It is located on the Chat page above other users.</p>
        <p>Making “My AI” optional and having the ability to unpin it from the top of the page can help resolve this— it makes the page more customizable for the user's preferences and makes the feature's presence less obtrusive. Below are the proposed changes:</p>

        <p>After:</p>
